We have to design a message queue supporting publisher-subscriber model. It should support following operations:

It should support multiple topics where messages can be published.
Publisher should be able to publish a message to a particular topic.
Subscribers should be able to subscribe to a topic.
Whenever a message is published to a topic, all the subscribers, who are subscribed to that topic, should receive the message.
Subscribers should be able to run in parallel


Pending:
1. Implement asynchronous methods (DONE)
2. Implement inteface is better way (DONE)
3. Assign variable type in each methods
